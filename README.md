Flask OpenStack Project
Project Description
This project is a web-based application built using Flask (Python web framework) that integrates a Kaggle-trained machine learning model. The application is designed to run in a cloud environment using OpenStack for scalability. It allows users to interact with the model and utilize cloud storage for file management.

Key Features
Flask Backend: Implements the logic for handling requests and integrating with the machine learning model.

Kaggle Model Integration: Connects to a Kaggle-trained model through an API for real-time predictions.

OpenStack Deployment: The application is deployed on OpenStack to demonstrate cloud scalability.

Cloud Storage Integration: Uses Firebase (initially) and will explore OpenStack Swift for cloud file storage.

Frontend: A user-friendly interface built using HTML and Bootstrap for displaying predictions and results.

Installation Instructions
To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

Python 3.x or above

Pip (Python package manager)

Git

OpenStack (for deployment)

Kaggle API (for model integration)

Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Danyal1251/flask-openstack-project.git
cd flask-openstack-project

Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install the required Python dependencies using the requirements.txt file:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 3: Set Up Kaggle API (Optional)
Place your Kaggle API credentials in the .kaggle/kaggle.json file. You can get your credentials from Kaggle's API page.

Step 4: Run the Flask Application
Start the Flask development server:
python app.py

The application should now be running at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

How It Works
The user interacts with the web app through the frontend (HTML/Bootstrap).

The Flask backend handles the requests and makes calls to the Kaggle API for model predictions.

File uploads are handled via the cloud storage integration (Firebase/OpenStack Swift).

The backend is hosted on OpenStack for scalability, ensuring it can handle multiple tenants and users.

Usage
Open the app in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Use the UI to upload data or interact with the application.

The application will send the data to the machine learning model and display the result.
